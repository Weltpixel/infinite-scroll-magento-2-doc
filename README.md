  <h2>ABOUT THE MAGENTO 2 AJAX ADD TO CART AND QUICK VIEW EXTENSION.</h2>
  <h3>WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT, HOW DOES IT HELP?</h3>
                        <ul>
                        <p>
                        Magento 2 Infinite Scroll & Ajax Catalog Extension lets customers explore more content by smoothing the pagination experience or eliminating it altogether.

One of the most important parts of building your online store is creating a website with the least amount of friction. Less friction = better user experience. Needless to say, this results in a higher conversion rate; generating higher revenue and increased customer lifetime value. Category pages and search result pages are the most visited sections of your ecommerce store. It is critical that these are user friendly. Helping customers explore more content and find what they’re looking for gives them longer, more satisfying browsing experiences.

You have the option to go with two major browsing behaviours, infinite scrolling (load more) and pagination. Each UX behaviour has its benefits and we often recommend testing what works best for your customers.

Infinite scroll is commonly used by social media websites such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Your customers were educated to scroll down by the Social Media giants. This user experience works great for mobile devices, which can generate 70- 80% of the total traffic depending on your industry! Another benefit of using Infinite scroll is the dynamic auto loading of new products without refreshing the entire page. Your customers can simply scroll up to view and compare previous products.

Pagination is also very commonly used around ecommerce websites such as Amazon.com and REI.com. Pagination helps divide content into multiple pages. We load the next page by using Ajax technology - reducing friction by removing the need to reload the entire page. When a user reaches the bottom of a page and clicks to go from page #1 to page #5 we dynamically load page #5 content without refreshing the page and automatically scroll the user to the top. Pagination is also helpful for product curation. You can pick the best 50 products from a category to display on the first page. This gives you more control and optimizes the initial presentation to the customer.

The Magento 2 Infinite Scroll Extension doesn’t make you choose between complete auto load or lessening the friction of pagination. We offer the best of both worlds! With this Magento extension, you can select a custom number of pages to auto load then display the load more button. This allows you to quickly display the best products automatically, while cutting down on the initial load and increasing page speed. Your customers won’t get annoyed by never reaching the bottom and you get to display the best items of each category first. It’s a 'win! win! win!' solution.

When implementing this solution we also focused heavily on improving SEO. The solution closely follows Google’s Infinite Scroll implementation. It generates rel=next and rel=prev at the correct page in conjunction with the canonical tag.

<h3 style="font-weight: 600;">HOW TO TAKE AJAX INFINITE SCROLL TO THE NEXT LEVEL IN MAGENTO?</h3>
                                <p>
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>
                                    <strong>"Loading More Items" Text</strong> - Define the text that will display after the Load More button is clicked/tapped while the new content is loading
                                </li>
                                <li>
<strong>Show "Load more" button</strong> - In Magento you already predefined how many products to display on the category page. Let’s consider you set it to 25. This option defines after how many pages to display the load more button. Ex. 2 pages will load 2X25 products = 50 then it will display the Load More button. This option creates the balance by keeping your category pages light on initial load, having the ability to reach the footer easily and gives you the opportunity to have control over what is the most important on the page. By setting the value to 0, the Load more button will never display and it will automatically load new products until all the products from the category gets displayed.
</li>
<li>
<strong>"Load More" button text</strong> - The text that will display on the button “Load More” / “Show More”
</li>
<li>
                                    <strong>No More Items Text</strong> - The text that will display as soon as all products from the category get loaded
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Start Loading Early</strong> - To Make the scrolling experience even smoother, you have now the option to pre-load products when the customers are approaching the end of the list with new products. Setting this value to Yes will prevent when there is a normal browsing experience the customer from waiting on the next page to load. This option will only work for the first few pages defined in STEP 3 or for all if set to 0
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Negative Margin</strong> - Load new items earlier considering the pixels offset configured. More items will start loading when you have less than specified pixels until the bottom of the page. Ex. 250. This option is only valid if Loading Early is set to Yes
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Enable canonical and prev/next link elements</strong> - We followed closely how Google is recommending the implementation of the rel=next, rel=prev and canonical tag.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Custom Loading Placeholder</strong> - Enable to be able to upload your own custom loading image.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Placeholder Width</strong> - Choose the maxmimum width of the placeholder image you uploaded in pixels. For example, for a width of 50 px, insert "50".
                                </li>
                                </p>
